Day-2 tasks 

First Program: Vowel Counter

Program asks the user to enter a string.
Takes a string as input.
Given vowels string as aeiouAEIOU so that it takes both upper and lowercase vowel letters.
Program checks if any character from the given input string is present in the vowels string and increases count by 1 for each character if so.
Program calculates the number of vowels and displays the result.

Second Program: Palindrome Checker

Program takes user input word
Program uses a simple loop that reverses the input word character by character 
Program then compares the reversed word with the original input word. 
The program then displays the appropriate message based on the comparison result.

Third Program: List Comprehension

The given program asks the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.
The input string is split into individual strings using the split() method.
Each string is converted to an integer using a list comprehension.
Now, another list comprehension is used to generate a new list.
The new list will contain only the even numbers from the list of integers.
The program then displays the new list of even numbers.

Fourth Program: Character Frequency Counter

The user enters a string.
An empty dictionary char_frequency is made to store the frequencies of characters.
A loop iterates through each character in the input string. 
If the character is already in the dictionary, its count is incremented. 
Otherwise, a new entry is added with a count of 1.
The program displays the dictionary containing the frequency of each character.

Fifth Program: Prime Number Checker

The user is prompted enters a number.
If the number is less than 2, it's considered not prime and the program displays corresponding message.
If the number is 2 or greater, the program iterates from 2 up to the square root of the number. 
If the number is divisible by any of these values, it's not prime and the loop breaks.
If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the program concludes that the number is prime and displays the corresponding message.
